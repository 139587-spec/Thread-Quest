Heyyy!! My name is Avantika Satheesh and I build this interactive clicker game! Ever since I was likek 10 years old, I was always obsessed with clicker game and woudl play them until my fingers got tired. I loved collecting the awards and watching myself progress through the game. That's why when I had the oppurtunity to make my own game, a clicker game seemed like the perfect option. This is a reletively simple game, but I promise it is fun! It is inspired by my hobby, crocheting, which you can know more about on the prevois project ( I have link it in the bottom). The game revolves around clicking the big yarn in the middle, and from there you can ugprade to different patterns like blankets and scarfs. You can also earn automatic clicks, and helpers to help you. There are also popups that show up every once in a while to give you a small reward! All of this can be received by collecting coins, which can be earned by, guess what, clicking the yarn button! You can earn achievements throughout the game when you reach checkpoints.
